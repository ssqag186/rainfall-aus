Rainfall Prediction with Machine Learning
Author: An Quang Nguyen
Organization: WeatherTech Inc.

Overview
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict whether it will rain tomorrow, based on historical weather data. The analysis leverages a variety of weather features—including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and previous rainfall—to train and evaluate a Random Forest classifier. The goal is to provide more accurate and actionable rainfall forecasts for practical decision-making.

Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, feature selection, encoding)

Model training using a Random Forest classifier

Hyperparameter tuning with cross-validation

Evaluation using accuracy score and confusion matrix

Visualization of results (confusion matrix, accuracy bar chart)

Easy-to-understand outputs for non-technical audiences

Dataset
The dataset consists of historical daily weather observations from various locations in Australia. Key features include:

Minimum and maximum temperature

Rainfall amount

Wind speed and direction

Humidity and pressure

Cloud cover and sunshine

RainToday (target: whether it rained today)

RainTomorrow (target for prediction: whether it will rain tomorrow)

Usage
Clone this repository.

Install the required Python packages (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, etc.).

Run the Jupyter notebook to see the full analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Generated visualizations (such as the confusion matrix and accuracy bar chart) can be found in the output files and used for presentations.

Results
The Random Forest model achieves an accuracy of approximately 84% in predicting rainfall for the next day.

Visualizations and summary tables make the results accessible for non-technical audiences.

Presentation
